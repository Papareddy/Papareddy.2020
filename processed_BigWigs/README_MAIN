This folder contains processed bigwig files for all 24nt-siRNA and methylation datasets investigated in this study (Both Public and our lab generated datasets).

Bigwig files are  readily available when the repository is git cloned.

Wig file wih four columns (column1 - chromosome without chr prefix; column2 - start position; column3 - end position; column 4 - sRNA/mCHH score)was converted to BigWig file with UCSC wigToBigWig command.

These BigWig files can be directly loaded into  The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV browser) or any other  web based genome browsers, such as :

* AnnoJ browser (http://neomorph.salk.edu/1001.aj.php)
* Plant methylome browser from Bob Schmitz lab (http://epigenome.genetics.uga.edu/PlantMethylome/)
