24nt siRNAs cotranscriptionally synthesised by RNA Pol IV and RDR2 (~25-30nt) and are robustly diced in 24mers by DICERs. 
These 25-30nt precursors are trancient and not seen in WT sRNAseq libraries but can be seen  when DICERS are mutated.

These precursors can serve as a proxy to see active RNA Pol IV mediated transcription of 24nt siRNAs.

These BigWig Files have scores of 25-30nt sRNA normalized RPM from dcl234 mutant Leaf, Early heart and floral bud samples.
